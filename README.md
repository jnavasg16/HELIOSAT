# HelioSat Mission Control

> **This MVP does not use mock, synthetic, interpolated, or forecasted data.**

A real-time aerospace telemetry dashboard for monitoring live space weather and satellite positions. Every value shown is sourced directly from live external APIs or computed via physics-based algorithms from real orbital data. If a source is unavailable, the dashboard displays "Unavailable" or "Not available" — it never fills gaps with synthetic values.

## Data Sources

| Panel | Source | Endpoint |
|---|---|---|
| L1 Solar Wind — Magnetometer | NOAA SWPC | `https://services.swpc.noaa.gov/products/solar-wind/mag-2-hour.json` |
| L1 Solar Wind — Plasma | NOAA SWPC | `https://services.swpc.noaa.gov/products/solar-wind/plasma-2-hour.json` |
| NOAA Alerts | NOAA SWPC | `https://services.swpc.noaa.gov/products/alerts.json` |
| Satellite TLE Catalog | CelesTrak | `https://celestrak.org/NORAD/elements/gp.php?GROUP=stations&FORMAT=tle` |

## What Is Directly Fetched

The following values are **parsed directly from API responses** with no transformation beyond unit-preserving field extraction:

- **Magnetometer**: `time_tag`, `bx_gsm`, `by_gsm`, `bz_gsm`, `lon_gsm`, `lat_gsm`, `bt`
- **Plasma**: `time_tag`, `density`, `speed`, `temperature`
- **Alerts**: `product_id`, `issue_datetime`, `message`
- **TLE catalog**: satellite name, TLE Line 1, TLE Line 2 (validated format only)

---

## What Is Computed from Real TLE via SGP4

The following values are **derived by propagating real TLEs** using the `satellite.js` SGP4 implementation. No fictional positions, altitudes, or velocities are generated:

- **Latitude / Longitude**: ECI → Geodetic conversion via `satellite.eciToGeodetic` at current UTC
- **Altitude (km)**: Geodetic height from SGP4 propagation result
- **Velocity (km/s)**: Euclidean magnitude of ECI velocity vector `√(vx² + vy² + vz²)`
- **Inclination (deg)**: Extracted directly from the `satrec.inclo` field (radians → degrees), not inferred
- **Orbit path**: 100-point forward-propagation trace from the TLE, one minute per step

If SGP4 propagation fails for a satellite (e.g., TLE is too old or degenerate), all availability flags are set to `false` and no value is displayed.

## Hard Rules Enforced Throughout the Codebase

- ❌ No `Math.random()` anywhere
- ❌ No mock or synthetic data files
- ❌ No hardcoded fake numerical values (solar wind speed, altitude, velocity, etc.)
- ❌ No interpolation of missing data points
- ❌ No smoothing of time series
- ❌ No extrapolation or forecasting from current conditions
- ❌ No artificial risk scores or storm scenarios
- ❌ No `|| 'fallback-string'` masking of absent API fields (fields are exposed as `null`)
- ✅ Missing values explicitly shown as **"Not available"**
- ✅ Failed sources explicitly shown as **"Unavailable"**
- ✅ Disconnected modules explicitly shown as **"Not connected"**

## Known Limitations

- **No real-time auto-refresh**: The dashboard is server-rendered on each page load. Client-side live updates for satellite positions use a 1-second `setInterval` running `satellite.js` locally — no polling of the API. NOAA/CelesTrak data is fetched fresh on each browser navigation.
- **SGP4 accuracy**: SGP4 is the standard orbital model for NORAD TLEs. It is accurate for low-to-medium Earth orbit over short time spans. It does not account for atmospheric drag beyond the TLE epoch or high-precision manoeuvre modelling.
- **Inclination extraction**: `inclinationDeg` is taken from `satrec.inclo` (stored in radians by `satellite.js`), which is the direct TLE field — not computed from the propagated position.
- **L1 Monitor Marker**: The L1 position shown in the 3D view is a **conceptual indicator** at a fixed Sun-facing point. No actual spacecraft ephemeris (e.g., DSCOVR or ACE) is connected.
- **Solar wind and B-field vectors**: These are rendered in the 3D scene only when real NOAA data is available. Direction and magnitude are qualitative visual aids — they are not precision-scaled physical vectors.
- **Forecast Module**: Entirely disabled. No synthetic forecast is generated. The panel will remain in a "not connected" state until a real NOAA/NASA forecast endpoint is integrated.
- **Mobile**: The layout is desktop-first. Tablet is usable. Mobile screens may have horizontal overflow.
- **CelesTrak group**: Only the `stations` group (ISS, CSS, etc.) is fetched by default. The service layer supports dynamic group names (`starlink`, `weather`, `active`) but they are not enabled in the UI.
